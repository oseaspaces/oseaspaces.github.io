At CZNSTUDIOS in Amsterdam we have detailed, fabricated and installed the interior and  mirror cabinets. Design collaboration with Jordi van der Oord.

The open wall structures, combined with fluorescent light bars positioned behind the blue frames, delivers a dynamic effect as one moves through the space, or observes as a passerby from the busy Amsterdam street.
