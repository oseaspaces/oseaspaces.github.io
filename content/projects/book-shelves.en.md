This modular shelving system was developed in collaboration with our friend and interior designer, Jamie van Haasteren for Studio Jop van Bennekom.

We contributed the steel framework: light-grey, minimal components that frame the solid oak shelves. The design emphasizes airiness and lightness while complementing the industrial character of the office space.
