In this apartment, several rooms had to be reconfigured to maximize space. To create distinct areas while maintaining the flow of natural light, we installed subtle steel room partitions with large sliding doors featuring fluted glass.

The fluted glass strikes a balance, offering privacy in each room while allowing light to filter through, creating a dynamic, colorful effect. The sliding doors can be fully opened, enabling flexible use of space as needed.
