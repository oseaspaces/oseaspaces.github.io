This modular shelving system is a collaboration with our friend and interior designer, Jamie van Haasteren. We contributed by crafting the steel components. The slim frames, finished with a blue-grey coating to go with the warm, natural appearance of the solid oiled oak shelves. The result is an elegant yet industrial piece of furniture that seamlessly integrates into the office space of Jop van Bennekom.
