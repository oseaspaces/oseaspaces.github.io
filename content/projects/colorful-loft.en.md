In this loft style-apartment, living room and bedroom were initially separated by a solid wall. To create a greater sense of spaciousness and bring more natural light into the bedroom, we introduced a glass and metal partition with a curved corner and slim doors that open from floor to ceiling. The design draws inspiration from Parisian caf√© facades, featuring slim metal frames, and large glass panels. The steel is finished in a typical French soft green hue.

The look has been modernized with clean, simple lines, focusing on practicality, light flow and integration in the modern style of the apartment.
