In this modern loft style-apartment, the living room and bedroom were initially separated by a solid wall. To create a greater sense of spaciousness and bring more natural light into the bedroom, we introduced a glass and metal partition with a curved corner and slim doors that open from floor to ceiling. 

The design draws inspiration from 20th century Parisian caf√© facades, featuring slim metal frames, and large curved glass panels. The steel is finished in a typical French soft green hue.
