This orangery was designed and decorated for a rural family home in Normandy. To make it possible to enjoy the garden and sunlight year-round, we designed and built an orangery that allows natural light to flood the space, and that seamlessly blends with the outdoor environment.

The orangery features a modern slim steel frame and a lean-to glass roof. The wide doors, which open outward, offer an open connection between the interior and the garden, allowing for natural ventilation during the summer months.

The decoration is inspired by vintage French charm and romantic cinema, with details that highlight colours of surrounding plants and flowers. As a focal point in the garden, this space is ideal for big family dinners or a quiet retreat to read a book, enjoying the green surroundings.
