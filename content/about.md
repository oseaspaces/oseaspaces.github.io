**OSEA** is a family-run spatial design studio based in Amsterdam and Marseille. We specialize in interior architecture, set design, custom furniture fabrication and creative direction for private residences, retail spaces and showrooms. As a family, we bring together diverse expertise and backgrounds to deliver projects with technical precision and personal signature.

Allard is a skilled welder with extensive experience in interior and furniture building. Walt has a background in industrial design engineering and technical drawing, and knows how to visualize ideas from concept sketches to accurate table-drawings. Julia, who works as art director for film and commercials, brings experience in conceptual set design and interior decoration. Together we manage complete spatial design projects, from the initial sketch, to refined construction and decoration.
