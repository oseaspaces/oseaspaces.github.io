**OSEA** is a family-run spatial design studio based in Amsterdam and Marseille. We specialize in interior architecture, furniture fabrication and set design for private residences, retail spaces and showrooms. As a family, we bring together diverse expertise and backgrounds to deliver projects with technical precision and personal signature.

Allard is a skilled welder with extensive experience in interior and furniture building. Walt has a background in industrial design engineering, and translates ideas into precise technical drawings and 3D models.  Julia works as art director for film and commercials, and brings experience in cinematic set design and furnishing.

Together, we oversee interior projects from the initial sketch to final installation, creating spaces that are light, characteristic and functional.

We invite you to get in touch to discuss your project or request a quote.
